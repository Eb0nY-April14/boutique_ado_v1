<!-- The structure for this toast_success page comes from the bootstrap documentation
with the exception of our custom toast class & these two divs at the top. -->
<!-- The data auto-hide & data dismiss attributes are required to prevent auto-hiding the 
notification after a few seconds & instead, give the user the ability to dismiss it on their own. -->
<div class="toast custom-toast rounded-0 border-top-0" data-autohide="false">
    <div class="arrow-up arrow-success"></div>
    <div class="w-100 toast-capper bg-success"></div>
    <!-- The toast is organized into a header & a body. The header  
    has a heading on the left & a close button on the right. -->
    <div class="toast-header bg-white text-dark">
        <strong class="mr-auto">Success!</strong>
        <button type="button" class="ml-2 mb-1 close text-dark" data-dismiss="toast" aria-label="Close">
            <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
        </button>
    </div>
    <!-- The body of the toast below contains the message template variable since
    this is going to be included in the message container in the base template i.e 
    the message that'll be displayed here to the user will come from base.html file. -->
    <div class="toast-body bg-white">
        {{ message }}
